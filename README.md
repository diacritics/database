# Diacritics Database

The meaning behind this repository is to collect diacritics with their associated ASCII characters in a structured form. It should be the central place for various projects when it comes to diacritics mapping.

As there is no single, trustworthy and complete source, all information need to be collected by contributors manually. However, parts of the data is generated automatically.

Example mapping:

> Sch**รถ**n => Sch**oe**n  
> Sch**oe**n => Sch**รถ**n

This repository contains the database of the project.

## Documentation

The specification can be found in the [spec folder](./spec/).

## Contributing

Thanks for contributing :tada: Most data is user-contributed so your help is really much appreciated.  
To get started, please read the documentation. It should give you the basic idea of the database structure. Then you can start reviewing existing, unvalidated language files or create new ones in the [source folder](./src/). Unvalidated languages contain a comment in the header of the file to indicate that they need to be reviewed by a native speaker.
